    <p>I’m a 20-year-old <span>computer science</span> student at the University of California, San Diego, and I transferred here from the College of San Mateo. I grew up in a small town near Yosemite, and moving to a big university by the coast has pushed me to grow in all the best ways. I’ve always been curious about how things work, whether it’s technology, people, or systems, and that curiosity is what drew me to computer science in the first place.
<br><br>
 I have many different interests, but <span>math</span> has always come naturally to me, and it’s what led me to start studying for the <span>actuarial</span>exam. Lately, I’ve been especially interested in <span>financial technology</span> and how <span>programming</span>, <span>data</span>, and <span>finance</span> can come together to create smarter and fairer systems for everyone. In my free time I love training dogs and animal welfare is a huge passion of mine.</p>
